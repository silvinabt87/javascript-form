##How do I contribute?
1. Fork repository by clickin on "Fork". Find it on the top right of the page.
2. Clone the fork you've just created: ```git clone git@github.com:<YOUR-OWN-USERNAME>/javascript-form.git```
3. Open the files on a code editor (like VSC or Sublime) and change the code! Introduce new features or improve existing ones.
4. Add the changed files to be tracked: ```git add .``` for all the files to be tracked or ```git add <FILE NAME>``` to track only certain files
5. Commit the changes onto your branch: ``` git commit -m "<MESSAGE ON WHAT THE COMMIT DOES>". Remember to follow the pattern "This commit will..."
Example: "This commit will add index.html file"--> git commit -m "add index.html file"
6. Push the changes onto your repository: ```git push origin master```
7. Create a pull request to merge the changes onto the original repository. Check [this](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) out to find out more about pull requests.
